I got your link in private message and read up on it again now.

To clarify: I commented on the formal API definition, and you indeed addressed
all my concerns, so this is now an ioctl command that follows our usual
calling conventions.

However, this is orthogonal to the question of whether it is a good idea
to have this interface implemented as an ioctl as asked by Greg, and who
is actually using it. 

I'm lacking the detailed subsystem knowledge to answer this, but
I note that other block drivers have similar passthrough interfaces.

Looking through what other drivers do, I've found a couple of patterns
now. n particular, most use the SG_IO ioctl to pass down commands
from user space into a device specific command queue. Have you looked
at that interface in the past to see if it would fit your use case?

There is also a 'bsg' API that some drivers implement, which I think
would be another alternative.

Could any of the SCSI experts comment on what they expect a driver
to use out of those three alternatives (if any): 

* private ioctl
* bsg
* sg_io
