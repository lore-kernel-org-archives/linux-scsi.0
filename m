The header file dependencies of scsi/scsi_netlink_fc.h are not explicit.
I will propose a patch which includes <stdint.h> in userspace then.

Tools parsing and checking uapi headers need to be able to compile them
and thus need the explicit list of dependencies. If <stdint.h> is a
required dependency, then scsi/scsi_netlink_fc.h should include it.

scsi/scsi_netlink_fc.h is one of 42 problematic headers left in current
kernel and I want to fix it one way or the other.
