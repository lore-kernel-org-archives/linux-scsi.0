Hello
Its not going to be tens of thousands of devices. That count was an
aggregate based on 1000's of servers.
In reality its unlikely to ever be more than 100 tapes drives per
individual Linux kernel instance.
Therefore sysfs will be the valid way to do this and make the data
available to user space.

Thanks
Laurence
