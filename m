> virtualization vendors who support this offload do it at a layer above the guest-OS(Intra-LUN(tm) locking or whatever fancy locking). So I think 'copyfile' is going to be appealing to application-developers more than the hypervisor-vendors.

The application is thin provisioning, not the 'cp' command. When
virtualisation vendors do support this, it will mainly be as part of
their image management toolkits, not the hypervisor.

'Am I done' is easy: copyfile() returns with the number of bytes that
have been copied.

'Is my copyfile() syscall making progress' is the question that needs
answering.

Then you have to check the entire range on error instead of just
resuming the copy from where it stopped.
