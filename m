Hi greg k-h,

in our code, we used the IOCTL during runtime, in order to determine some
information about the RPMB well known lun.
with the rpmb lun ID we could then go to /dev/sgX and issue
UFS_IOCTL_QUERY to this lun and get the data -
reading the QUERY_DESC_IDN_GEOMETRY descriptor and reading the
QUERY_DESC_IDN_UNIT descriptor.

this was crucial to the work we do in RPMB.

thanks,
Yaniv
