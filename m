Um, well, then why do you want DIX?  If you don't care about having the
client verify the data, that means you trust the integrity of the page
cache and then you just use the automated DIF within the driver layer
and SCSI will verify the data all the way up until block places it in
the page cache.

The whole point of supplying protection information to user space is
that the application can verify the data didn't get corrupted after it
left the DIF protected block stack.

How does it know it got correct data if it doesn't verify?  Something
might have corrupted the page between the time the block layer placed
the DIF verified data there and the client reads it.

supplying protection information to user space isn't about the
application checking what's on disk .. there's automatic verification in
the chain to do that (both the HBA and the disk will check the
protection information on entry/exit and transfer).  Supplying
protection information to userspace is about checking nothing went wrong
in the handoff between the end of the DIF stack and the application.
