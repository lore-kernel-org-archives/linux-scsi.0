SCSI does as well, it's the APTPL flag.  However reservations not persistent
through a power loss are basically useless, so I decided to force them on
in the API.  From the documentation:

"All implementations are expected to ensure the reservations survive
 a power loss"

So I would prefer not to add it, or if we really have to as a negative flag
to specifically opt out of the APTPL behavior.

This sounds like a sensible addition to me, and I wouldn't be surprised
if future SPC versions will add this flag.
