Aside from the "do we want to do this all in a single file" issue that I
will say more on below, this patch has issues.  Please don't use a
kobject for _ANYTHING_ in sysfs that has a struct device as a parent.
If you do that, it can't be seen by userspace tools very well, if at
all.

Instead, if you want to create a directory, just use an attribute group,
which will be created at the proper time (before the device is announced
to userspace), and then userspace can see it with the tools it is used
to using (i.e. libudev and friends.)

That should simplify your code a lot, please make that change no matter
what happens here with the content of the files.

One of the primary reasons we created sysfs and the "one value per file"
rule is that multi-value files just do not work well.  Yes, you get an
atomic snapshot, and you save some open/read/close syscall roundtrips,
but you do so at the expense of forcing userspace to "know" what the
format of the file is.  And once you create it, you can NEVER CHANGE IT
AGAIN.

Yes, that's right, if you come up with some new statistic in the future,
or realize that one of the ones you have now is wrong, you can't change
it, you have to make a whole new file, otherwise you could break
userspace tools.

Instead, a one-value-per-file rule forces userspace to know that if the
file is present, it can be opened and read from for a single value.  If
it isn't there, it should fail properly and move on to the next
statistic.  If you want to add a new statistic, great, just add a new
file and you are set.

You aren't dealing with performance-sensitive numbers here that "have"
to have an atomic snapshot of the state at a specific point in time in
order to work properly, so just have a bunch of files, all one value per
file, then all userspace tools will "just work" (i.e. libudev), and
everyone is happy.

And yes, open/read/close does take take a few extra cycles, but you
can't really measure it for a virtual filesystem like this on any modern
system.

Hope this helps explain why we have the sysfs rule, and why you should
continue to follow it as well.

Yes, it's not always followed, but that's usually because people forgot
why we had this rule, and no one noticed or pointed it out to me that it
was wrong.
