Any userspace application can be a tool.
We already implemented and used a user space application, that sent
queries to the UFS devices in order to get information and descriptors.
Not only ioctl interface is a useful way to interact with the device,
we used it, and found it very helpful in varies cases.
hence, this patch.
This patch has been already addressed all comments of Arnd Bergman from 5
months ago, and now, re-uploaded again.

thanks,
