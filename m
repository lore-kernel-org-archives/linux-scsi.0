Fair enough, but please feel free to cc: me on the patch that you do
feel is correct to get a sysfs-related review.

We already handle i/o stats just fine, why create a special sysfs
interface for just a tape device interface?  What makes them so special?

What sysfs file is a 2d int array?  I'll be glad to fix it.

Also, everyone doesn't think their solution will ever need to be
changed.  Until later when it does :)

If you want to measure tens of thousands of tape devices then you
shouldn't be using sysfs in the first place as it is not designed for
"speed" at all.  Use the existing i/o rate interfaces instead, don't try
to cram something into sysfs that doesn't belong there.
