Will do; I'm back from travels this week & will have some time to look at
this.

But the iostats use exactly the sort of array file we're talking about:

$ cat /sys/block/sda/stat 
  127644    20869  4320505  2305697   154045    30056  3834036  9065092        0   931842 11371357

And we can't simply extend these to tapes as they are not block devices.

So far as I'm aware there is no other way to obtain performance data
for the SCSI tape subsystem (without resorting to ftrace/systemtap).
