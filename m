This patch was really meant as an RFC. But it is absolutely my intent to
expose these to userspace. Albeit only to applications that supply or
request protection information via Darrick's aio extensions.

I also use these errors extensively in my test utilities to verify that
the correct problem gets detected by the correct entity when I inject an
error.

I should add that in the past I had a separate error status inside the
bip that contained the data integrity specific errors. But that involved
all sorts of evil hacks when bios were cloned, split and stacked. After
talking to nab about his needs for target I figured it was better to
just define new error codes and handle them like Hannes did for the
extended SCSI errors.
