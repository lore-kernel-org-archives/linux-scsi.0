If you don't have the hardware, how are you testing this patch?

And if you don't have the hardware I guess you don't need this change :)

That's a horrible reason to merge a patch that someone else is going to
have to support for 20+ years with an api that doesn't make much sense.

If you don't have the hardware, then this isn't needed.  But if you do,
then please look into using sysfs for this, as I think that should be
the correct interface here, again, not some random ioctl.
