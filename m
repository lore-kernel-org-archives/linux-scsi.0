I will submit proposal or new RPMB layer for both UFS and EMMC 
It also sports IOCTL interface, similar and replacing to mmc_ioc_cmd which is also used to access RPMB partition on emmc.
Blocks  of 512 bytes has to be transferred back and force so sysfs API is not good enough.  RPMB partition is not suitable to be accessed via block layer.  I've tried going via SICSI generic layers, it is a bit awkward as the protocol is very UFS specific.  
Currently I have working solution for both EMMC and UFS2.0.
