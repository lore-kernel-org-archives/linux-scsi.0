This makes sense indeed. My argument was only about the exposure of
the storage hw format cksum to userland (through some new ioctl for
further userland verification of the pagecache data in the client
pagecache, done by whatever program is reading from the cache). The
network fs client lives in kernel, the network fs server lives in
kernel, so no need to expose the cksum to userland to do what you
described above.

I meant if we can't trust the pagecache to be correct (after the
network fs client code already checked the cksum cached by the server
and sent to the client along the server cached data), I don't see much
value added through a further verification by the userland program
running on the client and accessing pagecache in the client. If we
can't trust client pagecache to be safe against memory bitflips or
software bugs, we can hardly trust the anonymous memory too.
