Please have a look at Documentation/CodingStyle Chapter 7: Centralized =
exiting=20
of functions. Especially this part:

<quote>
The goto statement comes in handy when a function exits from multiple
locations and some common work such as cleanup has to be done.  If ther=
e is no
cleanup needed then just return directly.

and the example below that section.

=2E. Will see if it can be factored. Not sure though.

Yes please. It's not uber important but short functions and paths are
generally favoured when debugging and reviewing code.
