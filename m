Nope unfortunately not. That's why it's nice when people trim their e-m=
ails
;-)

Ususally you change your code and do a git commit --amend. This modifie=
s your
commit instead of creating a new one. If you already have a new commit =
than
you can use git rebase -i <version befor commit to amend> and squash th=
e
commit's into one (git gives you a nice readme when doing rebase -i). A=
fterwards
you do a git format-patch -1 -v 2, this creates a v2-0001-your-patch-na=
me.patch
for git send-email which has an updated [PATCH V2] in the subject.

At least, the above is the way I do it (i.e. there are more than one wa=
ys to
do it).
