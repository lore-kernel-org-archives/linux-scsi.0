The tape driver does not have access to the block device i/o statistics because the tapes are not block devices but character devices. They use the Linux block subsystem enough to do i/o but this does not include access to the statistics counters.

The purpose of the suggested text vector format patch is to create statistics that have the same format as the existing i/o statistics that the block devices so that the existing tools can be used with minimal modifications. One alternative is, of course, to tie the st driver more into the Linux block device system. I have looked into this several times but have never seen how to do this in a simple enough way.
