Sorry, "8 hours" was a joke--no, you can't require the server to predict
whether an operation will take more or less than some precise duration.

I'm assuming the "fast" case that Al's proposing we do as a first step
cover CoW operations?  (So O(1) or close to it, users typically won't be
asking for progress reports, operation may be atomic (with no
partial-failure case), ?)
