I would have a strong preference for a single file containing an array
of integer counters. This is in keeping with other statistics attributes
in sysfs and follows the principle of least surprise: it's essentially
the same general format as /proc/diskstats and sysfs disk and partition
stats (dm statistics also follow this convention via the @print_stats
message).

This simplifies userspace code to read and parse the counters and avoids
additional sample jitter when reading stats for very large numbers of
devices; each device would require at least eleven open()/read()/close()
cycles.

For a small number of devices this shouldn't matter too much but
eventually the additional syscall overhead could become significant (I
think you mentioned users with ~20k devices?).

The sync file mechanism in the v2 patch that addresses this problem is
kinda cute but also significantly more complex than a plain old array
and as you pointed out adds hundreds of lines to the patch..

Sticking to arrays also allows existing tools like sysstat to be easily
adapted to the new data source.

Right: I think there's good precedent for the array file style when
dealing with counter sets.
