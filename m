I can't speak for Shane but wouldn't spend too much time looking at the
current v2 patch: it's the result of a pretty ugly compromise suggested
on linux-scsi.

This thread was really to try to settle the discussion on the structure
of the stats files.

I am not convinced this is a concern for tape statistics: they are pretty
much a solved problem. The commercial *nixes have had this for decades.

Likewise for disk stats: although fluff like maj:min/name etc. has been
shuffled a few times the basic fields have remained unchanged for a very
long time and sysfs already removes the need to include an identity
field.

I understand the fact that you can't change them; I just don't think it's
a big problem in this specific case (and much less than some of the
more imaginative sysfs content - 2d int arrays with column headers
anyone?).

I'll try to get some numbers when I get back home next week - Shane is
talking about use cases involving tens of thousands of tape devices. I
am not certain that the overhead would be unmeasurable in that case: the
additional context switching & TLB flushes alone seem like they would
add up.

Perhaps sysfs.txt should be updated to make the position more clear? The
current wording seems rather more liberal than this thread would
suggest. Maybe something like the patch below?

This would help people who are trying to dtrt by reading the documentation.

  Subject: [PATCH] docs/sysfs: Specify array valued attribute review
   requirements
  
  Although the linux-api position that one-value-per-file is a strong rule
  is very clear in mailing list discussions the sysfs.txt documentation
  suggests a rather more liberal stance:
  
  "... it is socially acceptable to express an array of values of the same
  type."
  
  Fix the documentation to make it clear that such uses should be
  discussed on linux-api first.
