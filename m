I broadly agree with this, but even if you do sync writes and cache read
only copies, we still have the problem of how we do the read side
verification of DIX.  In theory, when you read, you could either get the
cached copy or an actual read (which will supply protection
information), so for the cached copy we need to return cached protection
information implying that we need some way of actually caching it.
