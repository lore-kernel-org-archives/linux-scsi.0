Actually, right now Ceph doesn't check btrfs' data integrity
information, but since Ceph doesn't have any data-at-rest integrity
verification it relies on btrfs if you want that. Integrating
integrity verification throughout the system is on our long-term to-do
list.
We too will be said if using a kernel-level integrity system requires
using DIO, although we could probably work out a way to do
"translation" between our own integrity checksums and the
btrfs-generated ones if we have to (thanks to replication).
