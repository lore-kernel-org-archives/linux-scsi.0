Hello,
	So, looking at this, I don't see how it supports the algorithm I've been using
for years. For that algorithm to successfully migrate PRs across multiple paths
on a single machine without affecting other possible users (who may legitimately
have PR'ed the same device) I need PR_IN SA 1, READ RESERVATIONS to assure the
current node owns the reservation before attempting to preempt it on another
path. This can also assure that the device hasn't been reserved with a legacy
reservation.

	So, this leads me to two more general questions. The first is why isn't the PR
API simply exported to filesystems as a general reserve/release so that the PR
happens during mount/dismount. Then DM and friends can be setup to transparently
migrate or share the reservation, rather than depending on userspace to handle
these operations...
	Also, it seems to me the use of CLEAR is extremely dangerous in any environment
where actual arbitration or sharing of the resource is taking place.


	thanks,
