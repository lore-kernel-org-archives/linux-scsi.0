The other argument against using a size_t is that there is no memory
buffer involved here. size_t is, after all, a type describing
in-memory objects, not files.

That works, but why do we care so much about the difference between a
length and an offset as a return value?

To be fair, the NFS copy offload also allows the copy to proceed out
of order, in which case the range of copied data could be
non-contiguous in the case of a failure. However neither the length
nor the offset case will give you the full story in that case. Any
return value can at best be considered to define an offset range whose
contents need to be checked for success/failure.

The '-1' was not intended to be a special/magical value: as far as I'm
concerned any end offset that covers the full range of supported file
lengths would be OK.

Returning an end offset would satisfy the partial progress requirement
(with the caveat mentioned above).
