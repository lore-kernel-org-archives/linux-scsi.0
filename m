I think it just comes down to potential confusion for users. What's
more useful, the number of bytes actually copied, or the offset into the
file where the copy ended?

I tend to the think an offset is more useful for someone trying to
copy a file in chunks, particularly if the file is sparse. That gives
them a clear place to continue the copy.

So, I think I agree with Trond that phrasing this interface in terms of
file offsets seems like it might be more useful. That also neatly
sidesteps the size_t limitations on 32-bit platforms.

Yuck! How the heck do you clean up the mess if that happens? I guess
you're just stuck redoing the copy with normal READ/WRITE?

Maybe we need to have the interface return a hard error in that
case and not try to give back any sort of offset?

Agreed. A "whole file" flag might also be useful too, but I'd leave
that for after the initial implementation is merged, just in the
interest of having _something_ that works in the near term.
