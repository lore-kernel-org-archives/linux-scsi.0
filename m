As far as libaio is concerned I had a PoC working a few years ago. I'll
be happy to revive it if people are actually interested. So a real world
use case would be a great help...

But James is right that buffered I/O is much more challenging than
direct I/O. And all the use cases we have had have involved databases
and business apps that were doing direct I/O anyway.
