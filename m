But that only matters if the application is going to verify if data are 
really on disk. For example (client server scenario)

1) client-A writes a page
2) client-B reads this page

client-B is simply not interested here where it gets the page from, as 
long as it gets correct data. The network files system in between also 
will just be happy existing in-cache crcs for network verification.
Only if the page is later on dropped from the cache and read again, 
on-disk crcs matter. If those are bad, one of the layers is going to 
complain or correct those data.

If the application wants to check data on disk it can either use DIO or 
alternatively something like fadvsise(DONTNEED_LOCAL_AND_REMOTE) 
(something I wanted to propose for some time already, at least I'm not 
happy that posix_fadvise(POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED) is not passed to the file 
system at all).
