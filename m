I guess the write performance could be mostly solved somehow, but then still the read-cache would be entirely missing. From Lustre history I know that server side read-cache improved performance of applications at several sites. So I really wouldn't like to disable it for FhGFS...

This is interesting.  I imagine the Linux kernel NFS server will have the same issue: it depends on the page cache for good performance, and does not, itself, use direct I/O.

Thus it wouldn't be able to use a direct I/O-only DIF/DIX implementation, and we can't use DIF/DIX for end-to-end corruption detection for a Linux client - Linux server configuration.

If high-performance applications such as databases demand corruption detection, it will need to work without introducing significant performance overhead.
