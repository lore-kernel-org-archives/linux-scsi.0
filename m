Is this relying on btrfs range cloning being atomic?  It certainly
doesn't look atomic.  It can modify items across an arbitrarily large
number of leaf blocks.  It can make the changes across multiple
transactions which could introduce partial modification on reboot after
crashes.  It can fail (the dynamic duo: enomem, eio) and leave the
desintation partially modified.

Sure, I'm all for wiring up the simple version that doesn't return
partial progress.  If that'll work for you guys.
