Great, if in the future, you need this again, please resubmit it.
Adding code to the kernel for no real user is a maintaince burden on
others.  Please don't do that.  Especially for an API that is now
required to be supported for forever.

Why doesn't it?  Why would an ioctl make sense to get simple attributes
from a host controller?  Why not use the interface that makes it trivial
to use from userspace that other drivers already use in this type of
situation.

In other words, why do you have to have this ioctl?  What requires this
to be the way the API works?

But again, as you don't need this code, let's just drop it.  Feel free
to revisit it sometime in the future if you ever get hardware and need
this again.

thanks,
