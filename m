I think the point for network file systems is that they can reuse the 
disk-checksum for network verification. So instead of calculating a 
checksum for network and disk, just use one for both. The checksum also 
is supposed to be cached in memory, as that avoids re-calculation for 
other clients.

1)
client-1: sends data and checksum

server: Receives those data and verifies the checksum -> network 
transfer was ok, sends data and checksum to disk

2)
client-2 ... client-N: Ask for those data

server:  send cached data and cached checksum

client-2 ... client-N: Receive data and verify checksum


So the hole point of caching checksums is to avoid the server needs to 
recalculate those for dozens of clients. Recalculating checksums simply 
does not scale with an increasing number of clients, which want to read 
data processed by another client.


Cheers,
Bernd
