My preference is that if you want to expose any information that a user
or admin would care about, put it in sysfs where it is easily accessible
and can be scripted.

For things that need to directly send commands to the hardware (to
configure vendor specific settings or inspect parameters for development
purposes) use the sg or bsg interfaces like we do for both ATA and
SCSI. bsg is newer and supports more features like bidirectional
commands. But for this particular use case I don't think it offers any
particular advantages over SG_IO. Both interfaces take the same
descriptors so it really doesn't matter much.
