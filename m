*nod*.  The length type is limited by the syscall return type and the
arbitrary desire to mimic read/write.

I sympathize with wanting to copy giant files with operations that don't
scale with file size because files can be enormous but sparse.

Well, the resulting offset will be set if the caller provided it.  So
they could already be getting the copied length from that.  But they
might not specify the offsets.  Maybe they're just using the results to
total up a completion indicator.

Maybe we could make the length a pointer like the offsets that's set to
the copied length on return.

This all seems pretty gross.  Does anyone else have a vote?

(And I'll argue strongly against creating magical offset values that
change behaviour.  If we want to ignore arguments and get the length
from the source file we'd add a flag to do so.)

Yeah, btrfs doesn't allow partial progress.  It returns 0 on success.
We could also do that but people have expressed an interest in returning
partial progress.
