Hi Christoph,

I wrote an nvme implementation and it seems to work as expected with your
pr-tests (minor modification to open an nvme target). While API appears to
work as designed, there are a few features of NVMe that are unreachable
with it. For example, NVMe can ignore existing keys when acquiring a
reservation in addition to registering a new key. NVMe can also specify
if whether or not a reservation should persist through power-loss.

Anyway, I don't think SCSI has these same options. Should this new IOCTL
API accommodate the common subset to maintain its simplicity, or make
it more expressive for all features? The more important question might
be if there are any users requiring these features, and I honestly don't
know that right now.
