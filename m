Yeah, fair enough.  I'll rework it.

I don't think anyone will worry about checking file contents.

Yes, technically you can get fragmented completion past the initial
contiguous region that the interface told you is done.   You can get
that with O_DIRECT today.

But it's a rare case that is not worth worrying about.  You'll retry at
the contiguous offset until it doesn't make progress and then fall back
to read/write.
