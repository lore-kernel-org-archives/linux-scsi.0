No, the BUGS file is just stale. As you said was not ever updated. All
the bugs (1) in there do no longer exist for a long long time.
I will send a patch to remove the file.

Yes I maintain this fs. It has the complete fixture list, of what was
first intended. I keep running it every major kernel release to make
sure it actually runs, and there are no regressions.

If this FS stands in the way of any new development please anyone
contact me and I will help in the conversion. Of exofs and the
osd-uld.

Thanks
