Are you really sure you want protection information and the page cache?
The reason for using DIO is that no-one could really think of a valid
page cache based use case.  What most applications using protection
information want is to say: This is my data and this is the integrity
verification, send it down and assure me you wrote it correctly.  If you
go via the page cache, we have all sorts of problems, like our
granularity is a page (not a block) so you'd have to guarantee to write
a page at a time (a mechanism for combining subpage units of protection
information sounds like a nightmare).  The write becomes mark page dirty
and wait for the system to flush it, and we can update the page in the
meantime.  How do we update the page and its protection information
atomically.  What happens if the page gets updated but no protection
information is supplied and so on ...  The can of worms just gets more
squirmy.  Doing DIO only avoids all of this.
