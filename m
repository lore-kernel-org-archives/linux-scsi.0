copyfile(2) is probably a good way to go, provided that we do _not_
go baroque as it had happened the last time syscall had been discussed.

IOW, to hell with progress reports, etc. - just a fastpath kind of
thing, in the same kind of relationship to cp(1) as rename(2) is to mv(1).
If it works - fine, if not - caller has to be ready to deal with handling
cross-device case anyway.
