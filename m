I guess it would be useful for us, although right now data integrity is 
not on our todo list for the next couple of months. Unless other people 
would be interested in it right now, can we postpone for some time?

I guess we should talk to developers of other parallel file systems and 
see what they think about it. I think cephfs already uses data integrity 
provided by btrfs, although I'm not entirely sure and need to check the 
code. As I said before, Lustre does network checksums already and 
*might* be interested.
